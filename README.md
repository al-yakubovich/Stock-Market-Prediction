Stock Market Prediction by Recurrent Neural Network on LSTM Model

There are a lot of complicated financial indicators and also the fluctuation of the stock market is highly violent. However, as the technology is getting advanced, the opportunity to gain a steady fortune from the stock market is increased and it also helps experts to find out the most informative indicators to make a better prediction. The prediction of the market value is of great importance to help in maximizing the profit of stock option purchase while keeping the risk low. Recurrent neural networks (RNN) have proved one of the most powerful models for processing sequential data. Long Short-Term memory is one of the most successful RNNs architectures. LSTM introduces the memory cell, a unit of computation that replaces traditional artificial neurons in the hidden layer of the network. With these memory cells, networks are able to effectively associate memories and input remote in time, hence suit to grasp the structure of data dynamically over time with high prediction capacity.
